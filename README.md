# Master Visa Class (React)

This is a split, ready-to-edit React (Create React App) project converted to JavaScript (.jsx).
It includes Tailwind setup files and GitHub Pages deploy scripts in package.json.

Before using:
1. Replace `homepage` in package.json with your GitHub Pages URL: https://USERNAME.github.io/master-visa-class
2. Run:
   ```
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
3. To deploy to GitHub Pages:
   - create a repo on GitHub
   - add remote and push
   - run `npm run deploy`

Files generated from the original `master-visa-class.tsx` and split into components/pages.
